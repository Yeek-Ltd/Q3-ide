## <a id="manual-migration"></a>Manual Migration from Visual Studio Code to Q3 IDE

Q3 IDE (and a freshly cloned copy of vscode built from source) stores its extension files in `~/.vscode-oss`. So if you currently have Visual Studio Code installed, your extensions won't automatically populate. You can copy the `extensions` from `~/.vscode/extensions` to `~/.vscode-oss/extensions`.

Visual Studio Code stores its `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` file in these locations:

- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\Code\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/Code/User`

You can copy these files to the Q3 IDE user settings folder:

- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\Q3 IDE\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Q3 IDE/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/Q3 IDE/User`

To copy your settings manually:

- In Visual Studio Code, go to Settings (`Meta+,`)
- Click the three dots `...` and choose 'Open settings.json'
- Copy the contents of settings.json into the same place in Q3 IDE

## <a id="semi-automatic-migration"></a>Semi-Automatic Migration with "Sync Settings" Extension

The [**Sync Settings**](https://github.com/zokugun/vscode-sync-settings) extension can simplify the migration process by enabling synchronization of settings, keybindings, extensions, and more between Visual Studio Code and Q3 IDE. Its author is the main maintainer of Q3 IDE ;)

The extension is available in the Visual Studio Marketplace, OpenVSX or directly in its GitHub repository.

### Steps:

1. Install the **Sync Settings** extension in both Visual Studio Code and Q3 IDE.
2. Configure the extension on both Visual Studio Code and Q3 IDE:
  - Open Command Palette (`Meta+Shift+P`).
  - Search for `Sync Settings: Open the repository settings` and execute the command.
  - Configure the repository
3. Export your current settings from Visual Studio Code:
  - Open Command Palette (`Meta+Shift+P`).
  - Search for `Sync Settings: Upload (user -> repository)` and execute the command.
4. Import the settings into Q3 IDE:
  - I recommend the setting `"syncSettings.openOutputOnActivity": true,`.
  - Open Command Palette (`Meta+Shift+P`).
  - Search for `Sync Settings: Download (repository -> user)` and execute the command.
  - Wait for all the extensions to be downloaded and installed (follow logs in the `Output` panel) before restarting Q3 IDE.

This method ensures that all supported configurations are seamlessly transferred.
